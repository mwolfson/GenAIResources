# How I became an AI Hacker

I have been feeling stagnant in my current career and technology, and was looking for a way to explore the rapidly expanding technology feild of Artificial Inteligence (AI).

Over a decade ago, I was feeling the same way about my technology focus J2EE, and was looking for ways to explore technologies I was intested in. At that time, Android was evolving as a new technology and I was super excited about it. I would learn everything I could, and eventually created my own app to deploy to the store, so I could learn more.

I couldn't really figure out how to get involved in AI, in particular it seemed like a technology that is difficult to get started in, and create a small sample projects to explore.

I was talking with my mentor/friend Chris M, and he send me this message that changed my life
