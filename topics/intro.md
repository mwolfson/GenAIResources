# Artificial Intelligence (AI)

AI is a discipline

## Machine Learning

//todo - image 3 circles

ML is a subfield 

### Supervised\Unsupervised Learning

**Supervised Learning** - Has labeled data with tags

**Unsupervised Learning** - Look at raw data and identify patterns and grouping

### Deep Learning

definition....

used Neural Networks to process complex patterns. Neural Networks

//todo - image Neural Network

#### Model Types

**Discriminative **

- Used to classify or predict
- typically trained with labeled data
- learns relationship between features fo the data points and labels

**Generative**

- Used to generate new data similar to the data it was trained on
- Understands distribution of data and how likely the given result is
  - Very good at predicting next word in a sequence

## Generative AI (Gen AI)

Generative AI is a subset of DL that uses a NN and can process labeled and unlabeled data

### When to use

Use GenAI when your output is:

- natural language
- image
- audio

Use discriminative AI when your output is:

- Number
- Class
- Discrete
- Probability
