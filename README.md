## Prompt Engineering

### OpenAI - Video Course about Prompt Engineering basics from OpenAI

[https://learn.deeplearning.ai/](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/)

```text
In this course, we'll share with you some of the possibilities for what you can do, as well as best practices for how you can do them. 
There's a lot of material to cover. First, you'll learn some prompting best practices for software development, then we'll cover some common use cases, summarizing, inferring, transforming, expanding, and then you'll build a chatbot using an LLM. We hope that this will spark your imagination about new applications that you can build. 
```

## Large Language Model (LLM) Concepts

### Introduction To Generative AI Learning Path

### LangChain for LLM Application Development

[https://learn.deeplearning.ai/langchain](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/langchain)

```text
By prompting an LLM or large language model, it is now possible to develop AI applications much faster than ever before. 
But an application can require prompting an LLM multiple times and parsing its output, and so there's a lot of glue code that needs to be written. 
LangChain, created by Harrison Chase makes this development process much easier. I'm thrilled to have Harrison here, who 
had built this short course in collaboration with DeepLearning.ai to teach how to use this amazing tool.
```

[https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/)

```text
The OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications project aims to educate developers, designers, architects, managers, and organizations about the potential security risks when deploying and managing Large Language Models (LLMs). The project provides a list of the top 10 most critical vulnerabilities often seen in LLM applications, highlighting their potential impact, ease of exploitation, and prevalence in real-world applications. Examples of vulnerabilities include prompt injections, data leakage, inadequate sandboxing, and unauthorized code execution, among others. The goal is to raise awareness of these vulnerabilities, suggest remediation strategies, and ultimately improve the security posture of LLM applications.

### Steps to Install Open AI Tools using Jupyter Labs

1. Install [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (and PIP)
1. Use PIP to install following pakages
   1. `pip install openai`
   1. `pip install jupyterlab`
   1. `pip install python-dotenv`
   1. `pip install panel`
   1. `pip install notebook==6.5.4`
2. Get API Key and setup an Environment variables
   1. export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-dq...X"
3. Run `jupyter-lab`

#### Steps to first API call

These 3 steps are the basic steps to make an API call:

```python
import openai
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv())

openai.api_key  = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```

```python
def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
```

```python
text = f"""
You should express what you want a model to do by \ 
providing instructions that are as clear and \ 
specific as you can possibly make them. \ 
This will guide the model towards the desired output, \ 
and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant \ 
or incorrect responses. Don't confuse writing a \ 
clear prompt with writing a short prompt. \ 
In many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity \ 
and context for the model, which can lead to \ 
more detailed and relevant outputs.
"""
prompt = f"""
Summarize the text delimited by triple backticks \ 
into a single sentence.
```{text}```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```
