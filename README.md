In this course, we'll share with you some of the possibilities for what you can do, as well as best practices for how you can do them. 
There's a lot of material to cover. First, you'll learn some prompting best practices for software development, then we'll cover some common use cases, summarizing, inferring, transforming, expanding, and then you'll build a chatbot using an LLM. We hope that this will spark your imagination about new applications that you can build.
